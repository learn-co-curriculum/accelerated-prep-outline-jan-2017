## Week 2, Day 1
In this lecture, we'll cover some of the basic principles of JavaScript programming.

These concepts will lay the foundation for you to build and execute complex JavaScript programs. We'll learn about JS data types, variables, functions and scope. We'll also cover how to execute your code both in the browser console and using Node; and we'll cover the basic concepts of testing our code and learn how to execute those tests. Lastly, we'll introduce some helpful resources that you can use to continue learning and take deeper dives on your own and with your classmates.

* Data Types
* Declaring and Assigning Variables
* Defining and Invoking Functions
* Scopes

## Week 2, Day 2
In this lecture, we'll introduce the use data structures like arrays and objects to write more  We'll gain a basic understanding of control flow, and understand how we use it to teach our programs what to do. We'll learn how to implement control flow with `if` statements and looping.

* Arrays
  * Creating arrays
  * Accessing elements in arrays
  * Adding elements
  * Removing elements
* Objects
  * Creating objects
  * Accessing data in objects
  * Adding data to objects
  * Removing data from objects
* Control Flow
  * `if` statements
  * Looping
    * `for` loop
    * `while` loop
    
## Week 3, Day 1
In this lecture, we'll come to understand the DOM as a tree-like structure that we can operate on to add, remove to change elements. We'll practice selecting elements from a nested `document` object. We'll learn the concept of "callback functions" in JavaScript and leverage that understanding, together with the ceonepts of event listeners, to build interactive web pages with JavaScript.

* The DOM as a Tree
* Nested Objects
* Finding DOM Elements
* Creating and Inserting DOM Elements
* Removing Elements
* Callback Functions
* Event Listeners

## Week 3, Day 2
In this lecture, we'll learn how to use jQuery to modify HTML and build an interactive webpage. We'll conclude by building an interactive in-browser game!

* Using jQuery to Manipulate HTML
* jQuery Selectors
* jQuery Event Listeners
* Using jQuery to Move Elements
* Final Project: Rock Dodger!
